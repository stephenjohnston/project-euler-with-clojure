# Project Euler in Clojure

See src/euler/ folder for the solutions.  

From a clojure repl, you can do:  

;; Load the functions into the repl  
(use 'euler.problem1)  

;; execute the function to compute the solution to the problem  
(problem1)  
  
  
To get a clojure repl on your mac, you can do:  
brew install clojure  
brew install leiningen   
and then you can run "lein repl" in the top-level project folder (where the project.clj file exists)    
  
or try Clojure online - http://repl.it/ provides a browser-based Clojure repl for interactive exploration.
